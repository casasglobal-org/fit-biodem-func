# fit-biodem-func

Application to fit the rate of development on temperature as part of a set of bio-demographic functions for modeling basic biological processes in any organism using physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs, see <http://bit.ly/Gutierrez-1996> andÂ <https://doi.org/10.1603/EN12018>). The basic idea would be to develop functionality similar to the `devRate` R package (see <https://cran.r-project.org/package=devRate>) using the `lmfit` Python package (see <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>).
